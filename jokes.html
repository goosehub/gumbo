"Take dis pistol and go out and shoot six illegal aliens, six meth dealers, 
six Muslim extremists, and a rabbit." </p>

<h2>Cajun Women Are TOUGH!</h2>
<div class="joke-text">
<p>An elderly Cajun man lay dying in his bed. While suffering the agonies of impending death, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favorite beignets wafting up the stairs. </p>

<p>He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed. Gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he leaned against the door frame, gazing into the kitchen, where if not for death's agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven, for there, spread out upon waxed paper on the kitchen table were hundreds of his favorite beignets. </p>

<p>Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of love from his wife of sixty years, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man? He threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a crumpled posture. His parched lips parted, the wondrous taste of the beignets was already in his mouth. With a trembling hand he reached up to the edge of the table, when suddenly he was smacked with a wooden spoon by his wife. </p>

<p>"Stop" she said. </p>

<p>"Those are for the funeral."</p>

<h2>Seven Degrees of Coonass</h2>
<div class="joke-text">
<p>FIRST DEGREE 

<p>Boudreaux and his wife were asleep when the phone rang at 2 in the morning. Boudreaux picked up the phone, listened a moment and said "How should I know, that's 200 miles from here!" and hung up. </p>

<p>The wife said, "Who was that?" Boudreaux answered, "I don't know, some man wanting to know if the coast was clear." </p>

<p>SECOND DEGREE </p>

<p>Two Cajuns are wlking down the street. One notices a compact on the sidewalk and leans down to pick it up. He opens it, looks in the mirror and says, "Hmm, this person looks familiar." The second Cajun says, "Here, let me see!!" So the first Cajun hands him the compact. The second one looks in the mirror and says, "You dummy, it's me!" </p>

<p>THIRD DEGREE </p>

<p>Boudreaux suspects his wife of cheating on him, so he goes out and buys a gun. He goes to his house unexpectedly and when he opens the door he finds her in the arms of another man. Well, Boudreaux is really angry. He pulls out the gun, and as he does so, he is overcome with grief. He takes the gun and puts it to his head. His wife yells, "No, honey, don't do it!!!" </p>

<p>Boudreaux replies, "Shut up, you're next!" </p>

<p>FOURTH DEGREE </p>

<p>Boudreaux was bragging about his knowledge of state capitals. He proudly says, "Go ahead, and ask me, I know all of them." A friend says, "OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin ?" Boudreaux replies, "Oh, that's easy: W." </p>

<p>FIFTH DEGREE </p>

<p>What did the Cajun girl ask her doctor when he told her she was pregnant? </p>
"Is it mine?" 

<p>SIXTH DEGREE </p>

<p>Boudreaux, a Cajun in his fourth year as a LSU Freshman, sat in his US Government class. The professor asked Boudreaux if he knew what Roe vs. Wade was about. Boudreaux pondered the question then finally said, "That was the decision George Washington had to make before he crossed the Delaware. " </p>

<p>SEVENTH DEGREE 

<p>Returning home from work, Boudreaux was shocked to find his house ransacked and burglarized. He telephoned the police at once and reported the crime. The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the radio, and a K-9 unit patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the K-9 officer approached the house with his dog on a leash, Boudreaux ran out on the porch, shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps. Putting his face in his hands, Boudreaux moaned, "I come home to find all my possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? They send me a BLIND policeman."</p>

<h2>Blonde Boodro</h2>
<div class="joke-text">
<p>In the aftermath of Katrina, an Irishman, a Mexican and Blonde Boodro were doing construction work on scaffolding on the 20th floor of a building. </p>

<p>They were eating lunch and the Irishman said, 'Corned beef and  cabbage! If I get corned beef and cabbage one more time for lunch, I'm going to jump off this building.' </p>

<p>The Mexican opened his lunch box and exclaimed, 'Burritos again! If I get burritos one more time I'm going to jump off, too.' </p>

<p>Boodro opened his lunch and said, ' Bologna again! If Ah get a bologna sandwich one more time, Ah'm jumping too.' </p>

<p>The next day, the Irishman opened his lunch box, saw corned beef and cabbage, and jumped to his death. 
The Mexican opened his lunch, saw a burrito, and jumped, too. 
Then Blonde Boodro opened his lunch, saw the bologna and jumped to  his death as well. </p>

<p>All three bodies were laid out at the same funeral home. </p>

<p>At the funeral, the Irishman's wife was weeping. She said, 'If  I'd known how really tired he was of corned beef and cabbage, I never would have given it to him again!' </p>

<p>The Mexican's wife also wept and said, 'I could have given him tacos or enchiladas! I didn't realize he hated burritos so much.' </p>

<p>(Oh this is GOOD!!) </p>

<p>Everyone turned and stared at the Blonde Boo's wife as she said, 'Mais, don't look at me. Dat idiot made his own lunch.'</p>

<h2>The Easy Cajun</h2>
<h3>From George Chanay</h3>
<div class="joke-text">
<p>One morning Thibodeaux was sitting under the tree in his front yard patching holes in his shrimp net. His neighbor, Boudreaux, came out his front door, waved to Thibodeaux, and walked to his mail box.</p>

<p>He looked in the box, scratched his head a minute, and went back inside.</p>

<p>Half hour later Thibodeaux was still patching when Boudreaux checked his mail box again. This time he slamed the box shut and walked back inside mumbling.</p>

<p>Another half hour passed - Thibodeaux was still patching.</p>

<p>Boudreaux stomped to his mail box, yanked it open, looked in, and slamed it shut. He took a deep breath and started back to the house.</p>

<p>”Boudreaux, what's wrong?” Thibodeaux yelled.</p>

<p>“Dat computer my boy give me has lost it's mind” Boudreaux replied walking into the shade.</p>

<p>“You got a computer? I didn't know dat” Thibodeaux said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, Pierre give it to me yesterday - all hooked up to dat Inner Net” Boudreaux replied.</p>

<p>“Pierre. Dat's a good boy you got. What's he doin' now?” Thibodeaux asked.</p>

<p>“He's workin' over in N'Awlins, got a good job” Boudreaux answered.</p>

<p>“So what's wrong with da computer?” Thibodeaux asked.</p>

<p>“It just plain lost it's mind” Boudreaux replied.</p>

<p>“You saw me. Tree times I looked in dat box. Dere ain't nothin' dere. But dat computer keeps sayin' YOU'VE GOT MAIL.”</p>
